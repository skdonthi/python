1. Hello, World! - first program
2. Variables and Types: Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
3. Lists: Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.
4. Arithmetic Operators: Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.
